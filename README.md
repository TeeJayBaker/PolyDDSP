# PolyDDSP
Polyphonic generalisation of DDSP
[Paper](https://zenodo.org/records/10113134)

This is a work in progress directory for a complete rewrite of the current code-base, this will allow for running on more (non-CUDA) hardware and much easier understanding of processes. 

Working (if a bit finnicky) code is available [here](https://github.com/TeeJayBaker/PolyDDSP-Old), but keep an eye on this page for updates on the full project.
